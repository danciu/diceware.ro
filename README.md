> :warning:

> Letters with diacritics are interpreted as the ones without, hence there is no particular order between them.

> Per example, words starting with 's' are mingled with the ones starting with 'È™' - ordering depends on all the other letters in the word.

# Creating your own list

### 1. Edit the scripts as needed, then run:

```javascript
node src/index.ts
```

This will compile the Diceware script (dictionary words + Diceware Kit).

### 2. Trim the generated list as needed

Automatic trimming happens by modifying the constants in the `src/helpers/get-words-from-elements/get-words-from-elements.ts` file, after which you need to manually trim the file:

#### a. The easy way

`(TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_LINES - 7776) / 26`

Some letters, per example k, q, x etc. have very few entries, so usually you would have to remove more from the ones with a lot of words and very few, or none, from the other ones.

#### b. The hard way

Express judgement as to what is appropriate by cherry-picking the words to delete (e.g. ambiguous and offensive words - although both criteria are very subjective).

### 3. Add the dice numbers and create the final list

Use an app like Excel or Numbers to paste the dice numbers in one column, and the words list in the other.
Use the dice numbers available [here](https://github.com/danciu/diceware.ro/blob/master/resources/dice-numbers-7776.txt).
